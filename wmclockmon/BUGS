BUGS ?

If you cannot compile wmclockmon-config, it may be beacause you have not
installed the GTK+ development packages. As I did not made the configure
script and am not familiar with autoconf and automake stuff, ./configure
will not look for an installed GTK+ development package.

Be sure you have the gtk-config script in your path.

If, because of that, you do not want wmclockmon-config to be compiled nor
installed, just don't bother about the error messages for it.
